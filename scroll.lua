--- creating the callback.

---   "view_map": application's window creation.
---   "view_unmap": right before an application's window destruction.
---   "view_urgent": a window gets the urgent attribute set.
---   "view_focus": a window gets focus.
---   "view_float" a window becomes floating or goes back to tiled.
---
--- workspace events: cb_func is Lua function with two parameters, workspace
--- (the workspace triggering the event) and  data , the  cb_data  value passed
--- when creating the callback.
---
---   "workspace_create": called when a workspace is created.
---   "workspace_focus": called when focusing a workspace.
---
--- ipc events:
---
---   "ipc_view": called every time an IPC event for a window happens. cb_func
---     is Lua function with three parameters: view  (the view triggering the event),
---     change (a string with the event name), and data, the cb_data value
---     passed when creating the callback.
---   "ipc_workspace": called every time an IPC event for a workspace happens.

---     new_ws (the new workspace), change (a string with the event name), and
---     data, the cb_data value	passed when creating the callback.
---
